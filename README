Multi Away Module

Prevent your active IRC sessions from going away until all of your connected
clients do so.

v0.1 - Tested with a single network only, currently.
       It is expected that it will turn all networks away if all clients
       disconnect and otherwise, it will only turn individual networks
       away.
       Extraneous 306ing happens.
       No 305s are sent by the module.
